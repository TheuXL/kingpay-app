# KingPay App Configuration Summary

This document summarizes the work done to configure the KingPay app with proper endpoints based on the test files.

## Overview

The app uses Supabase Edge Functions for its backend API. The test files provide documentation on how to interact with these endpoints. We've implemented proper service layers and state management to handle the API calls.

## Implemented Services

### 1. PIX Keys Service (Endpoints 36-37)

- Implemented `pixKeyService` with proper TypeScript types
- Added methods:
  - `getPixKeys` - Get user's PIX keys
  - `listAllPixKeys` - List all PIX keys with pagination and filtering
  - `approvePixKey` - Approve or reject a PIX key
  - `simulateListPixKeys` - Simulate API response for testing

### 2. Ticket Service (Endpoints 7-15)

- Updated `ticketService` with proper TypeScript types
- Improved error handling
- Added methods:
  - `createTicket` - Create a new support ticket
  - `getTickets` - Get all tickets for the current user
  - `sendMessage` - Send a new message to an existing ticket
  - `getMessages` - Get messages for a specific ticket
  - `checkUnreadMessages` - Check if a ticket has unread messages
  - `markMessagesAsRead` - Mark messages in a ticket as read
  - `getTicket` - Get a single ticket by ID
  - `getMetrics` - Get ticket metrics
  - `updateStatus` - Update ticket status

## Implemented State Management

### 1. PIX Key Store

- Created a Zustand store for managing PIX key state
- Integrated with the PIX key service

### 2. Ticket Store

- Created a Zustand store for managing ticket state
- Added state for tickets, messages, and metrics
- Implemented actions for all ticket operations

## Updated Screens

### 1. PIX Key Screens

- Updated `pix-keys.tsx` to use the PIX key store
- Implemented proper UI for displaying PIX keys

### 2. Support Screens

- Updated `support.tsx` to use the ticket store
- Updated `ticket-details.tsx` to use the ticket store
- Updated `ticket-metrics.tsx` to use the ticket store

## Type Definitions

### 1. PIX Key Types

- Created `PixKey` interface
- Added types for API responses and parameters

### 2. Ticket Types

- Created `Ticket` and `TicketMessage` interfaces
- Added `TicketStatus` type
- Added types for API responses and parameters

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the remaining endpoints following the same pattern
2. Add more features to the UI based on the available endpoints
3. Implement proper error handling and loading states
4. Add unit tests for the services and stores
